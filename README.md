Company Listings for WP Job Manager.

## Description ##

Company Listing is a lightweight plugin for adding Company Listings functionality to your WordPress site. Being shortcode based, it can work with any theme (given a bit of CSS styling) and is really simple to setup. Shortcodes allow you to easily output individual companies in various formats, lists of companies, a company submission form and even an company dashboard which logged in users can use to view, edit and delete their listings.

### Features ###

* Outputs a list of all companies that have submitted job
* Lists all jobs under the company profile
* Moreover, it will be a custom post type, so can be easily searched or can make a directory for the company. And much more.
